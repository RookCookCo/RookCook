## Repository Navigation

Please only refer to the `RookCook/mernRC/src` and `RookCook/mernRC/backend` folders. These directories contain the core frontend and backend code of the application. All other folders were part of the initial MERN stack installation, and we have not modified them, as we are unsure if deleting them will affect deployment.

- **Frontend**: The frontend code is located in the `mernRC/src` folder. This directory contains all the components, styles (component CSS), and assets needed to build the user interface of the application. You can explore this folder to understand how the UI is structured and where specific components are implemented.

- **Backend**: The backend logic is housed in the `mernRC/backend` folder. This directory includes server setup and database models. Navigate through this folder to see how the server is configured and how it interacts with the database.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can:

- **Browse and Search for Recipes**: Discover a wide variety of recipes by searching through ingredients, cuisines, or meal types to find the perfect dish for any occasion.
- **Set Preferences in the User Profile**: Customize your experience by adjusting your profile settings, including dietary preferences and ingredient availability, to receive tailored recipe recommendations.
- **Participate in the Discussion Forum**: Engage with a community of fellow cooking enthusiasts by asking questions, sharing tips, and exchanging ideas to enhance your culinary skills.
